    "question": "What does the fuel tank store?",
    "correct_comment": "Correct! The Predator 212 is a gasoline engine with a spark plug. Oil goes in the crankcase. This engine is air-cooled (no coolant). Hydraulic fluid is for hydraulic systems, not engines.",
    "wrong_comments": {
      "Engine oil": "Engine oil goes in the CRANKCASE through the oil fill cap. The fuel tank is a separate container that holds gasoline for combustion.",

      "Stores excess fuel": "The fuel tank stores fuel. The muffler only handles exhaust gases that have already been combusted."
    }
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "The carburetor's job is to:",

    "wrong_comments": {
      "Piston and connecting rod": "The piston and connecting rod are inside the cylinder and crankcase \u2014 much deeper in the engine. The valve cover is on top of the head.",

  "Q9": {
    "question": "What do the rocker arms do?",

    "wrong_comments": {
      "Connect the piston to the crankshaft": "That's the connecting rod's job. Rocker arms are up in the head, transferring cam motion to the valves.",

    "wrong_comments": {
      "Piston ring": "Piston rings seal the piston to the cylinder WALL (inside). The head gasket seals the head to the cylinder BLOCK (on top).",

    }
  },
  "Q12": {
    "question": "Carbon deposits inside the combustion chamber are caused by:",
    "correct_comment": "Correct! Carbon is the residue from fuel and oil that didn't completely burn. Over time it builds up on the piston crown, valves, and chamber walls.",
    "wrong_comments": {
      "Too much airflow through the carburetor": "Too much air makes the engine run LEAN, which actually produces less carbon. Carbon comes from incomplete combustion of fuel and oil.",
      "Water in the fuel tank": "Water in fuel causes running problems and corrosion, not carbon deposits. Carbon is unburned fuel and oil residue.",

    "wrong_comments": {
      "The size of the exhaust port": "\"Bore\" refers to the cylinder interior, not the exhaust port. You're inspecting the wall surface for scoring, wear, or glazing.",
      "The depth of the combustion chamber": "Combustion chamber volume is a different measurement. \"Bore condition\" means the quality of the inner cylinder wall surface.",
      "The number of piston rings installed": "Ring count is a design spec. \"Bore condition\" = the state of the cylinder wall surface \u2014 smooth, scratched, scored, or worn."
    }
  },
  "Q17": {
    "question": "The crankshaft converts:",
    "correct_comment": "Correct! Picture the piston going up and down. What shape converts linear motion to rotation? A crank \u2014 just like a bicycle pedal converts your up-down leg motion into wheel rotation.",
    "wrong_comments": {

    "question": "The oil slinger in the Predator 212 lubricates the engine by:",
    "correct_comment": "Correct! The Predator 212 uses splash lubrication, not a pressurized oil pump. A paddle on the camshaft gear dips into the oil sump and flings oil everywhere.",
    "wrong_comments": {
      "Pumping oil under high pressure through galleries": "That's a pressurized oil system (used in cars). The Predator 212 is simpler \u2014 a slinger SPLASHES oil from the sump.",
      "Dripping oil from the valve cover onto the piston": "Oil doesn't drip down from above. The slinger at the BOTTOM spins and flings oil upward from the sump.",
      "Mixing oil directly into the fuel": "That's a TWO-STROKE engine method. The Predator 212 is FOUR-STROKE \u2014 oil stays in the crankcase, splashed by the slinger."

  "Q27": {
    "question": "During the compression stroke, what is happening?",
