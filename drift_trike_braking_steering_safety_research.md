# 1. BRAKING SYSTEM

## 1A. Front Brake: Keeping the Existing Bicycle Disc/Caliper Brake

### Can You Keep It?
**Yes -- and you should.** When you graft the donor bicycle's front fork, headset, and wheel into the new frame, the existing disc brake caliper, rotor, lever, and cable (or hydraulic line) can remain in place as-is. The front brake is operating on the same wheel, same fork, same mounting points -- nothing about the braking geometry changes just because the rear of the vehicle is different.

### Pros of Keeping the Bicycle Front Brake
- **Already proven and matched**: The caliper, rotor size, and pad compound were designed as a system for that wheel and fork. No fabrication needed.
- **Lightweight**: Bicycle disc brakes (mechanical or hydraulic) weigh very little.
- **Easy to service**: Pads and cables are cheap and available at any bike shop.
- **Modulation**: Bicycle hydraulic disc brakes (Shimano, Tektro, etc.) offer excellent progressive feel. Even mechanical bicycle disc brakes (Avid BB7, Tektro Novela) are well-modulated.
- **Cost**: Zero additional cost -- it's already on the donor bike.
- **Hand lever already on handlebars**: The existing brake lever stays, giving you an intuitive left-hand front brake control.

### Cons / Considerations
- **Stopping power limit**: A single bicycle brake caliper (typically 160mm or 180mm rotor) is designed to stop ~250 lbs (bike + rider) at ~25 mph. A drift trike at 12-18 HP could weigh 200+ lbs with a 150+ lb rider, going 25-35 mph. A single front brake alone is NOT sufficient.
- **Weight transfer on braking**: Under hard braking, a trike transfers weight forward (just like a car). This actually makes the front brake MORE effective, but on a trike with a single front wheel, aggressive front-only braking could cause the front to wash out in a turn or, in extreme cases, pitch the rider forward since the CG is low but rearward.
- **Fork stress**: The bicycle fork was designed for bicycle loads. With a heavier, faster vehicle, the fork sees higher braking forces. Inspect the fork for cracks regularly. A chromoly steel fork is preferred over aluminum or carbon.
- **Rotor size**: If the donor bike has a 160mm rotor, consider upgrading to 180mm or 203mm for more leverage and heat dissipation. Most forks have multiple mounting positions, or you can use a post-mount adapter.

### Recommendation for School Project
**Keep the front disc brake. Upgrade the rotor to 180mm if currently 160mm.** Use it as a secondary/modulating brake. The rear brake should be the primary stopping brake.

---

## 1B. Rear Brake: Disc Brake on Rear Axle

### Why You Need a Rear Brake
The rear axle is where the engine power goes. The rear brake is your primary stopping system. On a drift trike, the rear end is intentionally designed to slide, so the rear brake also serves as a drift-initiation tool (lock the rear, break traction, steer with the front).

For a school project at 12-18 HP, a rear brake is **mandatory, not optional**.

### Specific Products: Mechanical Disc Brake Kits for 1" Live Axle

**Go-kart brake kits designed for 1" keyed axles are the standard approach.** These bolt on and are specifically engineered for the loads, speeds, and axle sizes used in drift trikes and go-karts.

#### Top Recommended Products:

**1. MCP (MaxTorque Clone Performance) / Generic Go-Kart Disc Brake Kit**
- Widely sold on Amazon, Go Power Sports, OMB Warehouse, BMI Karts
- Includes: Mechanical caliper, 6" (152mm) or 8" (203mm) brake rotor, brake rotor hub (keyed for 1" axle), cable, mounting bracket
- 6" rotor kit: **~$25-40**
- 8" rotor kit: **~$35-55**
- Caliper is a single-piston, cable-actuated mechanical caliper
- This is the go-to budget option and is used on hundreds of drift trike builds

**2. Go Power Sports - Disc Brake Kit**
- gopowersports.com carries multiple disc brake kits
- "Brake Caliper Assembly" (mechanical, cable-pull): ~$15-25 for caliper alone
- Brake rotor, 6" with hub for 1" axle: ~$12-20
- Brake rotor, 8" with hub for 1" axle: ~$15-25
- Complete kit (caliper + rotor + hub + cable + lever): ~$35-55
- They also sell individual components if you need to mix and match

**3. BMI Karts - Disc Brake Kits**
- bmikarts.com carries "Go Kart Brake Kits"
- MCP-style mechanical disc brake complete kit: ~$30-50
- They carry both 6" and 8" rotors with keyed hubs
- Also sell upgraded calipers and larger rotors

**4. OMB Warehouse - Disc Brake Components**
- ombwarehouse.com carries calipers, rotors, hubs, cables
- Individual caliper: ~$15-25
- Rotor + hub combo: ~$15-25
- Complete kits: ~$35-55

**5. Amazon - Various Go-Kart Disc Brake Kits**
- Search: "go kart disc brake kit 1 inch axle"
- HIAORS, WPHMOTO, TDPRO, Wingsmoto brands: ~$20-45 for complete kits
- Quality varies -- stick to kits with good reviews (4+ stars, 100+ reviews)
- Many of these are the same MCP-pattern caliper from different sellers

#### Rotor Size Recommendation for School Project:
**Use an 8" (203mm) rotor minimum.** At 12-18 HP, the trike can reach speeds where a 6" rotor will fade under repeated braking. An 8" rotor provides:
- More braking torque (larger lever arm)
- Better heat dissipation (more surface area)
- Longer pad life
- Only a few dollars more than a 6" rotor

---

## 1C. Band Brake vs. Disc Brake on Rear Axle

### Band Brake
A band brake wraps a friction band around a drum attached to the axle. Common on vintage go-karts and some mini bikes.

**Pros:**
- Very simple -- one moving part
- Enclosed, less exposed to debris
- Cheap: ~$15-30 for a complete band brake assembly

**Cons:**
- **Poor heat dissipation** -- band brakes overheat quickly under repeated use. At 12-18 HP, this is a real problem.
- **Inconsistent feel** -- band brakes tend to grab suddenly rather than progressively. This is a safety concern.
- **Weaker stopping power** -- significantly less braking force than a disc brake of comparable size
- **Fade** -- as the band heats up, friction coefficient drops and braking power decreases dramatically
- **Limited adjustability** -- harder to dial in
- **One-direction bias** -- some band brakes work better in one direction of rotation

### Disc Brake
**Pros:**
- **Far superior heat dissipation** -- rotor is exposed to air
- **Progressive feel** -- easier to modulate, less grabby
- **Stronger stopping power** -- especially with 8"+ rotors
- **Easy to inspect and service** -- pads are visible, rotors can be checked for wear
- **Consistent performance** -- less fade than band brakes
- **Industry standard** -- go-kart racing and drift trike builds overwhelmingly use disc brakes

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex mounting (need a bracket to hold caliper)
- Exposed rotor could contact debris (minor issue on pavement)
- Slightly more expensive (~$10-20 more than a band brake)

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Disc brake, without question.** The superior stopping power, heat management, modulation, and safety make it the only responsible choice for a 12-18 HP vehicle in a school environment. Band brakes are a relic -- do not use one on this build.

---

## 1D. Hydraulic vs. Mechanical (Cable) Actuation

### Mechanical (Cable-Pull) Disc Brake
- Uses a steel cable from lever to caliper (just like a bicycle cable brake)
- The cable pulls a lever arm on the caliper, which pushes a single pad against the rotor
- The opposite pad is fixed (floating caliper design)

**Pros:**
- **Simple** -- easy to install, adjust, repair
- **Cheap** -- cable, housing, and caliper are inexpensive
- **Students can maintain it** -- no bleeding, no fluid, no seals
- **Readily available** -- every go-kart brake kit is mechanical
- **Easy to route** -- cable can be bent around frame tubes easily

**Cons:**
- Less braking force than hydraulic (single-piston, cable stretch absorbs some force)
- Cable can fray, rust, or bind if not properly routed
- Requires periodic adjustment as pads wear
- Less "feel" -- the cable introduces some slop

### Hydraulic Disc Brake
- Uses a master cylinder (at the lever) and a slave cylinder (the caliper) connected by a hydraulic line filled with brake fluid (DOT 3/4 or mineral oil)
- Squeezing the lever pressurizes fluid, which pushes pistons in the caliper against the rotor

**Pros:**
- Much stronger braking force for the same hand effort
- Better modulation and feel
- Self-adjusting as pads wear
- No cable stretch

**Cons:**
- **Significantly more expensive** -- a hydraulic go-kart master cylinder + caliper + line can cost $60-150+
- **Requires bleeding** -- air bubbles in the line ruin braking. Bleeding requires tools and knowledge.
- **Fluid is corrosive** -- DOT fluid damages paint and is an irritant
- **More complex failure modes** -- leaking seals, blown lines, air in system
- **Harder for students to service**
- **Overkill for this application** -- at drift trike speeds (15-30 mph), a well-set-up mechanical disc brake is entirely adequate

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Mechanical (cable-pull) disc brake for the rear.** It is simpler, cheaper, easier for students to understand and maintain, and entirely adequate for the speeds involved. The front can remain whatever the donor bike had (mechanical or hydraulic bicycle brake -- both are fine).

If the donor bike has a hydraulic front brake, keep it -- it's already a sealed, bled system. Just don't try to add a new hydraulic system to the rear if you don't have experience with it.

## 1E. Brake Rotor Mounting to Live Axle

### The Problem
The rear axle is a 1" solid steel round bar (live axle). You need to attach a brake rotor to it so the rotor spins with the axle. There are two common approaches:

### Option 1: Keyed Hub (RECOMMENDED)
- A **brake rotor hub** is a steel disc/flange with a 1" bore and a 1/4" keyway
- The hub slides onto the axle, a key locks it rotationally, and a set screw (or collar) holds it axially
- The brake rotor bolts to the hub using standard bolt patterns (typically 3-bolt or 4-bolt)
- **This is the standard method** used by all go-kart brake kits

**Pros:**
- Removable -- rotor can be replaced without cutting
- Properly aligned -- hub is machined to be concentric with the axle
- Proven design -- thousands of go-karts use this method
- Go-kart brake kits come with the hub included
- Set screws and keys allow adjustment of axial position on the axle

**Cons:**
- Must have a keyway cut in the axle at the hub location (or buy a pre-keyed axle)
- Set screws can loosen (use thread-locker and check frequently)

### Option 2: Welded
- Weld the rotor or a hub directly to the axle

**Pros:**
- Permanent -- won't come loose
- No keyway needed

**Cons:**
- **HEAT DAMAGE** -- welding to the rotor can warp it, making it wobble and causing uneven braking, vibration, and premature pad wear
- **Permanent** -- if the rotor wears out, you have to grind it off and weld a new one
- **Axle weakening** -- welding introduces a heat-affected zone (HAZ) that can weaken the axle
- **Alignment** -- very difficult to weld a rotor perfectly square and concentric to the axle without a lathe/jig
- **Not standard practice** -- no professional builder does this

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Keyed hub, absolutely.** Buy a brake kit that includes the rotor hub for 1" keyed axle. Cut a keyway in your axle (or buy a pre-keyed axle from a go-kart supplier). Use a 1/4" square key, a set screw with blue Loctite, and a shaft collar outboard of the hub as a backup retainer.

**Never weld a brake rotor to an axle.** The heat warpage alone makes this unsafe.

## 1F. Do You Need Both Front AND Rear Brakes?

### Short Answer: YES

### Why Both:
1. **Redundancy** -- if one brake fails, the other still works. For a school project, single-point-of-failure braking is unacceptable.
2. **Stopping distance** -- two brakes stop you in roughly half the distance of one brake.
3. **Weight transfer** -- under braking, weight shifts forward. The front brake becomes more effective as weight loads the front tire. The rear brake becomes less effective as weight unloads the rear. Using both gives you optimal total braking force.
4. **Drift control** -- the rear brake can be used independently to break rear traction for drifting, while the front brake can be used independently for speed modulation without losing rear traction.
5. **Legal/safety standard** -- virtually every motorized vehicle requires independent front and rear braking systems.

### How to Set Them Up:
- **Left hand lever** = Front brake (bicycle convention)
- **Right hand lever** = Rear brake (or use a foot pedal -- but handlebar lever is simpler for a drift trike)
- Alternatively: Right hand = throttle twist grip, left hand = front brake lever, and add a **foot pedal** for the rear brake. This is the most natural setup and mirrors motorcycle controls.

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Both front and rear brakes are mandatory.** The front brake is already free (from the donor bike). The rear brake kit costs $30-55. There is no reason not to have both, and every safety reason to require both.

## 1G. Kill Switch / Engine Stop Integration with Braking

### Basic Concept
The Predator 212 has a simple ignition system: a magneto generates spark. Grounding the magneto's kill wire stops the engine. A kill switch simply connects the kill wire to ground.

### Integration Options:

**1. Independent Kill Switch (Minimum Requirement)**
- A handlebar-mounted kill switch (toggle or push-button) wired to the engine's kill wire
- Rider can kill the engine at any time, independent of braking
- **This is the minimum -- every build must have this**

**2. Kill Switch + Tether / Deadman Switch (REQUIRED for School)**
- A tether (lanyard) clips to the rider and connects to a kill switch
- If the rider falls off or is thrown from the trike, the tether pulls and kills the engine
- This is the single most important safety device on the trike
- See Section 3A for specific products

**3. Brake-Activated Kill Switch (Optional but Nice)**
- Wire a normally-open switch to the brake lever or pedal so that applying the brake also grounds the kill wire
- This means full brake application = engine dies
- **Pros**: Fail-safe -- panicked rider who grabs the brake also kills the engine
- **Cons**: Engine dies every time you brake hard, which can be annoying during normal riding and means you have to restart frequently. Also, if the engine dies while moving, you lose engine braking.
- **Not recommended as the primary kill method** -- use a separate kill switch and tether instead. If desired, it can be wired to only activate at full brake application (switch at end of lever travel).

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
- **Handlebar kill switch**: YES, mandatory
- **Tether / deadman switch**: YES, mandatory for school
- **Brake-activated kill**: OPTIONAL -- only if students want to add it as an extra layer. Not a substitute for the tether.

# 2. STEERING

## 2A. Using Bicycle Front Fork and Handlebars

### What You're Starting With
The donor bicycle provides:
- Front fork (typically 1-1/8" threadless steerer tube, steel or chromoly)
- Headset (bearings that allow the fork to rotate in the head tube)
- Handlebars (flat bars, riser bars, or drop bars)
- Stem (connects handlebars to steerer tube)
- Front wheel with tire and brake

### Modifications Needed

**1. Head Tube Integration**
The most critical fabrication step is grafting the bicycle head tube into the new trike frame. Options:

- **Cut the head tube from the donor frame and weld it into the new frame**: This preserves the exact headset geometry. Cut the head tube with ~1" of the original frame tubes still attached (gives you weld material). Clean, prep, and weld it to the front of your square tube frame at the correct angle.
- **Use a new head tube**: Buy a raw bicycle head tube (available from bicycle frame building suppliers like Paragon Machine Works, or cut one from a scrap frame). Weld it to the front of your frame.

**2. Head Tube Angle (Rake/Caster)**
- Bicycle head tube angle is typically 70-73 degrees from horizontal
- For a drift trike, you generally want **65-72 degrees** -- slightly more relaxed (more caster) for stability at speed
- More caster (more relaxed angle, lower number) = more stable, slower steering
- Less caster (steeper angle, higher number) = quicker steering, less stable
- **Recommendation: 68-72 degrees** is a good range for a drift trike. This provides stability without being too sluggish.

**3. Fork Length Consideration**
- The fork must be long enough that the front wheel clears the frame
- If you use a 20" wheel with the original fork, geometry should work out
- If you change wheel sizes, you may need a different fork length
- The steerer tube must be long enough to extend through the head tube with room for the stem

**4. Trail**
- Trail is a function of head angle, fork offset (rake), and wheel size
- More trail = more stable, self-centering steering
- Typical bicycle: 50-65mm trail. For a drift trike, 50-80mm is reasonable.
- If using the stock fork in the stock head tube at a similar angle, trail will be in the right range automatically.

### RECOMMENDATION:
Cut the head tube (with bearing cups intact) from the donor frame. Weld it to the front of the trike frame at ~70 degrees. Install the fork, headset, wheel, and brake as a complete unit. This is the simplest approach and preserves proven geometry.

---

## 2B. Stem and Headset Considerations

### Headset
- Modern bicycles use a **threadless headset** (1-1/8" or 28.6mm steerer tube)
- The headset consists of upper and lower bearing cups pressed into the head tube, with bearings that allow the fork to rotate
- **When cutting the head tube from the donor frame, leave the headset cups pressed in.** Do not remove them. They are interference-fit and removing/reinstalling them without proper tools risks damage.
- If welding generates enough heat to damage the headset bearings (likely), you'll need to replace the bearings after welding. The cups can usually survive welding heat. Sealed cartridge bearings are cheap (~$5-15 per set).
- **Weld with the headset cups in but bearings removed.** Press new bearings in after welding and the frame has cooled.

### Stem
- A threadless stem clamps around the steerer tube and holds the handlebars
- Standard clamp diameter: 31.8mm (oversized, most common modern) or 25.4mm (older standard)
- **Keep the donor bike's stem** -- it's already sized correctly
- Stem length affects handling feel: shorter stem = quicker steering input. A 50-80mm stem is typical for a drift trike.
- Consider a **short, high-rise stem** to get the handlebars into a comfortable position for the trike's lower seating position (the rider sits much lower than on a bicycle).

### Handlebar Height
- On a bicycle, the rider is upright or forward-leaning. On a drift trike, the rider sits very low (near ground level).
- The handlebars may need to be significantly higher relative to the frame to be ergonomic.
- Options: Use riser handlebars (BMX-style risers can add 4-8" of height), use a high-rise stem, or weld extensions to the steerer tube.
- **Do NOT extend the steerer tube by welding a pipe on top of it** -- this is structurally dangerous. Instead, use proper bicycle components (tall risers, adjustable stem).

### RECOMMENDATION:
- Preserve the donor bike's headset cups in the head tube
- Remove bearings before welding, replace after
- Use a short stem (50-80mm)
- Use BMX-style riser handlebars for height
- Make sure handlebars are comfortable with rider in low-slung trike seating position

## 2C. Handlebar-Mounted Throttle (Twist Grip)

### What You Need
A twist-grip throttle on the right handlebar (motorcycle/scooter convention). This connects via a cable to the carburetor's throttle butterfly.

### Specific Products:

**1. Go-Kart / Mini Bike Twist Throttle Kit**
- Sold by Go Power Sports, OMB Warehouse, BMI Karts, and Amazon
- Kit includes: Twist grip housing (clamps to 7/8" / 22.2mm handlebar), throttle cable (~60-72"), and sometimes a cable bracket for the carb end
- **Go Power Sports**: Twist throttle assembly + cable: ~$10-20
- **OMB Warehouse**: Twist throttle kit: ~$10-20
- **BMI Karts**: Throttle kit: ~$12-20
- **Amazon** (HIAORS, WPHMOTO, etc.): Twist throttle + cable kits: ~$8-15

**2. Bicycle/Scooter Twist Throttle (Amazon)**
- Electric bicycle twist throttles are cheap but designed for electronic speed controllers, not cable-pull. **Do not use these.**
- Look specifically for **cable-pull** twist throttles designed for small engines.

**3. Predator 212 Throttle Cable Specifics**
- The Predator 212's carburetor (Huayi or clone) has a throttle arm that accepts a cable with a Z-bend or barrel end
- Aftermarket throttle cables designed for the Predator 212 / Honda GX200 are widely available
- Cable length: measure the distance from handlebars to carburetor and add 6-12" of slack. Typical: 60-72" works for most drift trikes.
- **Make sure the cable has the correct end fitting for your carb's throttle arm**

### Throttle Return Spring (CRITICAL SAFETY ITEM)
- The carburetor has a built-in return spring that closes the throttle when the cable goes slack
- **You MUST verify this spring is present and functional**
- **Add a secondary return spring on the throttle arm as a backup** -- a small extension spring from the throttle arm to a fixed point on the engine. This is a standard safety practice.
- If the cable breaks or disconnects, BOTH springs must independently return the throttle to idle (closed).
- **This is a non-negotiable safety requirement for a school project.**
- See Section 3B for more detail.

### RECOMMENDATION:
- Buy a go-kart twist throttle kit with cable from Go Power Sports or OMB Warehouse (~$10-20)
- Verify cable end fitting matches your Predator 212 carb
- Install the stock carb return spring AND a secondary external return spring
- Route the cable smoothly with no sharp bends (use gentle curves and proper cable housing)

---

## 2D. Handlebar-Mounted Brake Lever(s)

### Configuration Options:

**Option A: Two Hand Levers (Simplest)**
- Left lever = Front brake (keep from donor bike)
- Right lever = Rear brake (add a new lever, route cable to rear caliper)
- Throttle = Twist grip on right side (outboard of brake lever)
- **This mirrors motorcycle controls** (right hand = throttle + front brake on motorcycles, but here right = throttle + rear brake, left = front brake)
- Simple, minimal parts, intuitive

**Option B: Hand Lever + Foot Pedal**
- Left lever = Front brake
- Right twist grip = Throttle
- Foot pedal = Rear brake
- **More like a car/go-kart setup**
- Requires fabricating a pedal mount and routing a cable to the rear
- More complex, but arguably more natural for hard braking

### Specific Brake Lever Products:
- If you need a new brake lever (for the rear brake cable), a **bicycle brake lever** works perfectly. They pull cable, they mount on 22.2mm (7/8") handlebars, and they're cheap.
- Shimano, Tektro, or generic bicycle brake levers: ~$5-15 each
- Go-kart specific brake levers are also available but are essentially the same thing: ~$8-15

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Option A (two hand levers) is simplest and recommended.** Left = front, right = rear, right twist grip = throttle. The student's right hand operates both throttle and rear brake -- this is fine because you release throttle before braking (you can't twist throttle and squeeze brake simultaneously with one hand, which is actually a safety feature -- throttle is automatically released when braking).

---

## 2E. Handlebar-Mounted Kill Switch / Engine Stop Button

### Products:

**1. Go-Kart / Mini Bike Kill Switch**
- A simple momentary or toggle switch that mounts on the handlebar
- Wired to the engine's kill wire (grounds the magneto to stop spark)
- **Go Power Sports**: Kill switch: ~$5-10
- **OMB Warehouse**: Kill switch: ~$5-10
- **Amazon**: Universal motorcycle/mini bike kill switch: ~$5-10
- Typically a toggle switch (flip up = run, flip down = kill) or a push-button (press to kill)

**2. Motorcycle-Style Kill Switch / Run-Stop Switch**
- A thumb-operated rocker switch on the right handlebar cluster
- Red, clearly marked "RUN / STOP" or with universal symbols
- More ergonomic and intuitive than a toggle switch
- Amazon: ~$5-12

### Wiring:
- The Predator 212 has a single kill wire coming from the ignition coil
- Connect one terminal of the kill switch to this wire
- Connect the other terminal to a good ground (engine block or frame, IF the frame is grounded to the engine)
- When the switch is activated, it grounds the magneto and the engine dies
- **Simple two-wire circuit. No battery needed.**

### RECOMMENDATION:
- Mount a clearly-labeled kill switch on the right handlebar, within thumb reach while gripping the throttle
- Use a motorcycle-style RUN/STOP rocker switch for intuitive operation
- Paint it red or use a red switch for visibility
- Test it every time before riding

# 3. SAFETY EQUIPMENT -- REQUIRED FOR SCHOOL PROJECT

## CRITICAL NOTICE FOR SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT
This section covers items that are **non-negotiable for a school fabrication project**. The school, the instructor, and the students have a duty of care. Even if the trike is only operated on school grounds at low speed, all of these items should be implemented. A failure that results in injury at a school is a serious liability issue.

---

## 3A. Kill Switch / Tether (Deadman Switch)

### Why This Is the #1 Safety Item
If the rider falls off, becomes incapacitated, or loses control, the engine must stop immediately. A throttle that stays open on a riderless trike is an unguided missile. The tether ensures the engine dies the instant the rider separates from the vehicle.

### How It Works
- A lanyard (tether cord) attaches to the rider's wrist, clothing, or belt
- The other end attaches to a spring-loaded clip on the trike
- The clip holds a removable pin, magnet, or key in a switch
- If the rider separates, the tether pulls the pin/magnet, opening (or closing) the kill circuit
- The engine dies immediately

### Specific Products:

**1. Predator / Go-Kart Engine Tether Kill Switch**
- BMI Karts, Go Power Sports, OMB Warehouse all carry these
- Basic tether kill switch (lanyard + switch + mounting bracket): **~$8-15**
- Typically uses a pin that grounds the kill wire when pulled

**2. Boat/PWC-Style Safety Lanyard Switch (Recommended)**
- These are robust, proven, and designed for marine engine kill applications
- They mount to the frame or handlebars
- A clip-style lanyard attaches to the rider
- When pulled, the switch interrupts ignition
- Available on Amazon: **~$8-20**
- Brands: SeaStar, Sierra, generic marine safety switches
- **These are often more robust and proven than cheap go-kart tethers**

**3. Amazon Specific Options:**
- Search: "engine kill switch tether lanyard"
- "Boat kill switch with lanyard" -- many options, $8-20
- "Go kart tether kill switch" -- $8-15
- IMPORTANT: Make sure the switch is rated to handle the kill wire current (very low -- milliamps -- so almost any switch works)

### Wiring:
- Tether switch wires in **parallel** with the handlebar kill switch
- Either switch can kill the engine independently
- Wire diagram:
  ```
  Kill wire from engine --+--> Handlebar kill switch --> Ground
                          |
                          +--> Tether kill switch -----> Ground
  ```
- Both switches ground the magneto. Either one kills the engine.

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**A tether / deadman switch is MANDATORY.** Buy a marine-grade safety lanyard switch. Mount it prominently. The tether must be attached to the rider EVERY TIME the engine is running. No exceptions. Budget: ~$10-20.

---

## 3B. Throttle Return Spring (Failsafe)

### The Requirement
If the throttle cable breaks, detaches, or jams, the throttle must close (return to idle) immediately. An engine stuck at full throttle is an emergency.

### How to Achieve This:

**1. Primary Return Spring (Built into Carb)**
- The Predator 212's carburetor has a small spring on the throttle butterfly shaft
- This spring closes the throttle when cable tension is released
- **Verify this spring is present and functional before every operation session**

**2. Secondary / External Return Spring (MANDATORY for School)**
- Add a small extension spring from the carburetor's throttle arm to a fixed point on the engine (a bolt, a bracket, etc.)
- This spring must pull the throttle arm toward the closed position
- Spring force should be strong enough to close the throttle reliably but not so strong that it makes the twist grip too hard to operate
- Suitable springs: small extension springs from a hardware store, ~1-2 lbs of pull. Or purpose-built throttle return springs from go-kart suppliers.
- **Go Power Sports** and **BMI Karts** sell throttle return springs: **~$2-5**
- Or buy a small extension spring from a hardware store: **~$1-3**

**3. Cable Routing**
- Route the throttle cable so it cannot kink, bind, or get caught on frame components
- Use smooth, sweeping bends -- no sharp corners
- Use cable housing (outer sheath) for the full run to prevent snagging
- Secure the cable to the frame at regular intervals with zip ties or cable clamps
- Leave enough slack for full handlebar rotation (lock to lock) without binding

### Test Procedure:
Before every ride, perform this test:
1. With engine OFF, twist throttle open and release. It must snap back to idle position.
2. Turn handlebars fully left and fully right. The throttle must not change position -- cable routing must not bind.
3. Disconnect the throttle cable at the carb end. The throttle arm must snap closed on its own (both springs acting).
4. With engine running (trike on stand, rear wheel off ground), blip throttle and release. Engine must return to idle promptly.

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
- Verify the carb's internal return spring is present
- Add a secondary external return spring (~$2-5)
- Route cable carefully with housing
- Perform the throttle-snap-back test before every ride session
- **This is a critical safety item. Document the test in your project log.**

---

## 3C. Roll Bar / Overhead Protection

### Considerations for a Drift Trike
- A drift trike has a very low center of gravity (rider sits near ground level) and three wheels, making rollovers unlikely but not impossible (e.g., catching a curb, high-speed turning on grip tires on the front).
- A roll bar adds significant weight, complexity, and cost.

### Options:

**1. No Roll Bar (Common for Drift Trikes)**
- Most recreational drift trikes do not have roll bars
- The low CG and three-point contact make rollovers rare
- Rider can bail off the side if something goes wrong (if not belted in)
- **If there is no roll bar, DO NOT use a seatbelt/harness** -- the rider must be able to separate from the trike in a tip-over. A seatbelt without a roll cage can trap the rider under the trike.

**2. Roll Bar / ROPS (Recommended for School Project if Feasible)**
- A single hoop of 1.5" x 0.120" wall DOM (drawn over mandrel) steel tubing bent over the rider's head
- Bolts or welds to the frame behind and beside the rider
- Adds ~15-25 lbs
- Provides head protection in a rollover or collision with an overhead object
- **If a roll bar IS installed, then a lap belt or harness SHOULD also be installed** to keep the rider within the protected zone

**3. Compromise: Headrest / High Back**
- A tall seat back that rises above the rider's head, padded at the top
- Provides rear-impact head protection without the full weight/complexity of a roll bar
- Does not protect in a rollover

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
This is a decision for the instructor based on the project scope and expected use:
- **If the trike will only be used at low speed (under 20 mph) on flat, open pavement with no obstacles**: A roll bar is optional but still recommended. No seatbelt if no roll bar.
- **If the trike will be used at higher speeds or near obstacles**: A roll bar is strongly recommended, paired with a lap belt.
- **If building a roll bar is within the class's fabrication capability**: Do it. It's a great learning exercise in tube bending and adds meaningful safety.

## 3D. Chain Guard

### Requirement
An exposed drive chain can catch clothing, hair, fingers, or debris. A chain guard is a **mandatory safety item** on any chain-driven vehicle in a school environment.

### What to Build/Buy:

**1. Fabricated Chain Guard (Recommended -- Good Fab Exercise)**
- Bend sheet metal (16-20 gauge steel or aluminum) into a U-channel that covers the top run of the chain from the engine sprocket to the rear axle sprocket
- Must cover at least the **top run** (the tight, loaded side) and ideally both runs
- Must extend around both sprockets (at least partially -- the chain meshes with teeth there and finger/clothing contact is most dangerous)
- Fasten with bolts so it can be removed for chain service
- Leave clearance for chain movement (chain bounces and has slack)

**2. Purchased Chain Guard**
- Go-kart chain guards are available from go-kart suppliers
- **Go Power Sports**: chain guard: ~$5-15
- **BMI Karts**: chain guard: ~$5-15
- These are typically designed for specific go-kart frame configurations and may need modification to fit a custom drift trike frame
- Often just flat plates -- you may still need to fabricate a proper enclosure

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Fabricate a chain guard as part of the project.** It's simple sheet metal work, teaches layout and bending, and is a required safety item. Cover the full top run of the chain and wrap around both sprockets as much as practical.

---

## 3E. Engine Guards / Exhaust Heat Shields

### Exhaust Heat Shield
- The Predator 212's exhaust (stock muffler or aftermarket header/pipe) gets extremely hot (500-800 F surface temperature)
- The exhaust exits on the right side of the engine and typically routes rearward
- On a drift trike, the exhaust may pass near the rider's leg, the frame, or the rear wheel
- **A heat shield is mandatory if the exhaust passes within 6" of anything the rider can touch or any flammable material**

**Options:**
- Wrap the exhaust pipe with header wrap (fiberglass exhaust wrap): ~$10-20 for a roll from Amazon or auto parts stores. This reduces surface temperature and protects from burns.
- Fabricate a sheet metal heat shield (aluminum or steel) that stands off 1-2" from the exhaust pipe, mounted to the frame. This deflects radiant heat.
- **Best: do both.** Wrap the pipe AND add a shield between the pipe and the rider.

### Engine Guards
- The Predator 212 has exposed flywheel, governor linkage (if any remains), carburetor, and moving parts
- A fan shroud covers the flywheel on the stock engine -- **do not remove it**
- The carburetor and throttle linkage should be somewhat protected from direct impact (a rock kicked up, a crash, etc.) but typically the engine's own mass and the frame provide adequate protection
- **The belt/chain drive side is the most important area to guard** -- covered by the chain guard (Section 3D)
- Consider a simple engine bash plate (flat plate under the engine) if the trike will be used on uneven surfaces

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
- Wrap the exhaust with header wrap ($10-20)
- Add a sheet metal heat shield between exhaust and rider ($5-10 in material)
- Keep the fan shroud installed on the engine
- Fabricate a chain guard (Section 3D) to cover the drive side

---

## 3F. Seat Belt or Harness

### The Rule: ONLY with a Roll Bar
- **Never install a seatbelt/harness without a roll bar/cage.** In a tip-over without overhead protection, a seatbelt traps the rider under the vehicle. The rider's ability to separate from the trike is their primary protection in a rollover.
- **If you build a roll bar (Section 3C), then a lap belt is recommended** to keep the rider within the roll bar's protected zone.

### If Installing a Lap Belt:
- A simple automotive-style lap belt (2-point) bolted to the frame on either side of the seat
- Universal lap belt kits: ~$15-30 on Amazon
- Mount points must be structurally reinforced (gusset plates welded to frame at bolt points)
- Belt must be tight enough to prevent the rider from sliding out but loose enough for comfortable operation
- Quick-release buckle is mandatory -- the rider must be able to exit quickly in an emergency

### If Installing a Harness (4-point or 5-point):
- Significantly more complex mounting
- Requires shoulder mounting points on the roll bar
- Overkill for a drift trike unless it's being built as a high-speed vehicle
- Not recommended for this project unless the team is building a full cage

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
- **No roll bar = No seatbelt.** Rider wears a helmet and can bail off.
- **Roll bar installed = Add a lap belt.** Keep the rider in the protected zone.

---

## 3G. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) -- MANDATORY

### The following PPE must be worn by the rider during ALL operation:

**1. Helmet -- REQUIRED**
- Minimum: DOT-rated motorcycle helmet (half, three-quarter, or full-face)
- Acceptable alternatives: DOT-rated bicycle helmet (MIPS preferred), skateboard helmet (CPSC certified), or karting helmet (Snell K-rated)
- Full-face helmet is strongly recommended for maximum protection
- Must fit properly (snug, does not rock on the head)
- Budget: $30-80 for a basic DOT motorcycle helmet; school may already have helmets available

**2. Gloves -- REQUIRED**
- Protect hands from abrasion, vibration, and burns (exhaust contact)
- Leather or synthetic motorcycle/mechanics gloves
- Must allow full grip on handlebars and controls
- Budget: $10-30

**3. Long Pants -- REQUIRED**
- Protect legs from abrasion, burns, and chain contact
- Jeans or work pants minimum (not shorts, not thin athletic pants)
- Leather or Cordura overpants are ideal but not necessary for low-speed school use

**4. Closed-Toe Shoes -- REQUIRED**
- Boots or sturdy shoes
- No sandals, no open-toe shoes
- Over-the-ankle boots are preferred

**5. Eye Protection -- REQUIRED (if not using full-face helmet)**
- Safety glasses or goggles
- Must be impact-rated (ANSI Z87.1)
- If using a full-face helmet with a visor, this is covered

**6. Long Sleeves -- RECOMMENDED**
- Protect arms from abrasion and burns
- Not mandatory if the trike is low-speed, but good practice

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Minimum PPE to operate the trike: Helmet, gloves, long pants, closed-toe shoes, eye protection.** No exceptions. Write this into the project rules. The rider does not sit on the trike without all PPE on.

---

## 3H. Fire Extinguisher

### Requirement
A gasoline engine with a fuel tank on a fabricated vehicle = fire risk. This is a school environment.

**A fire extinguisher must be present and accessible during all operation.**

### Specifications:
- **Type**: ABC dry chemical (handles gasoline, electrical, and ordinary combustible fires)
- **Size**: Minimum 5 lb (2.5 kg) extinguisher
- **Location**: Within 25 feet of the operating area, not on the trike itself (it would add weight and might not be reachable in a fire)
- Have a **designated fire safety person** (student or instructor) who knows where the extinguisher is and how to use it
- **Check the extinguisher gauge** -- ensure it is charged (green zone) before each operation session

### Additional Fire Safety:
- Keep a bucket of sand nearby as a secondary fire suppression option
- No fueling the trike while the engine is hot or running
- Fuel the trike outdoors in a well-ventilated area
- Keep fuel in an approved gas can (red CARB/EPA-compliant container)
- No smoking within 50 feet of fueling or operation
- Clean up any fuel spills immediately

### Budget:
- 5 lb ABC fire extinguisher: ~$20-40 (likely already available in school shop)

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
**Fire extinguisher present at all times during engine operation. Period.** The school shop likely already has this. Verify it's charged.

## 3I. Speed Limiting Considerations

### The Problem
The Predator 212, de-governed, can push a lightweight drift trike to 30-45+ mph depending on gearing. For a school project, you may want to limit top speed to 15-25 mph for safety.

### Methods to Limit Speed:

**1. Gearing (Most Effective, Simplest)**
- Change the sprocket ratio to limit top speed
- Smaller driven sprocket (on rear axle) or larger drive sprocket (on engine output) = lower top speed for a given RPM
- This doesn't limit RPM, but limits road speed
- **Calculate your gear ratio and sprocket sizes** to target a desired top speed
- For a Predator 212 at 3600 RPM (stock governor speed) with 10" rear wheels:
  - A gear ratio of ~6:1 to 8:1 gives roughly 20-30 mph
  - A gear ratio of ~10:1+ limits speed to ~15-20 mph
- This is the simplest and most reliable method

**2. RPM Limiting (Electronic)**
- Even with the governor removed, you can limit RPM electronically
- **Aftermarket RPM limiter / rev limiter**: These devices interrupt the ignition at a set RPM
  - GX200/Predator 212 adjustable rev limiter: available from racing suppliers, ~$30-60
  - They wire between the ignition coil and the kill wire
  - Set the RPM limit to, say, 4000 RPM instead of allowing the engine to free-rev to 5000+
  - **This is a good safety measure for a school project**
- **DIY approach**: A centrifugal switch or tachometer with a relay can ground the kill wire above a set RPM, but this is more complex and less reliable than a purpose-built limiter

**3. Throttle Stop (Mechanical)**
- A physical stop (bolt or bracket) that prevents the throttle from opening more than, say, 50-75%
- Limits maximum airflow and therefore maximum power/RPM
- Simple: just a bolt on the carburetor that the throttle arm hits before reaching wide-open
- **Very easy to implement**: ~$0 in parts (just a bolt and nut)
- **Recommended as an additional measure alongside gearing**

**4. Restrictor Plate**
- A plate with a small hole placed between the carburetor and the intake manifold
- Limits airflow and therefore power
- Used in racing to equalize competition
- Effective but can cause the engine to run lean (hot) -- must re-jet the carb
- **Not recommended for a school project** due to the lean-running risk

### RECOMMENDATION FOR SCHOOL PROJECT:
- **Primary**: Set gearing to limit top speed to 20-25 mph
- **Secondary**: Install a throttle stop to limit maximum throttle opening to ~75%
- **Optional but recommended**: Install an RPM limiter (~$30-60) to cap RPM at ~4000
- **Document your top speed** with GPS or radar during testing and adjust gearing accordingly
