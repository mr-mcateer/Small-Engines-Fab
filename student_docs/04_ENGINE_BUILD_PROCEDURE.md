# PREDATOR 212 NON-HEMI - BILLET FLYWHEEL + ROD INSTALL
## Governor Removal | Billet Safety Upgrade

## WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY

Your engine already has Stage 1 mods (air filter, exhaust, carb work). Now we're doing two things:

1. **Removing the governor** so the engine can rev freely
2. **Installing the billet flywheel (ARC 6695) and billet rod (ARC 6254)** so the engine is SAFE to rev freely

We are **NOT** installing the performance cam or valve springs from the kit. The stock cam and springs are fine for our use. We want a reliable, safe engine - not a race engine. Keep the extra cam and springs in the box.

**Why billet even if we're going slow?**
Once the governor is gone, there's nothing stopping the engine from revving higher than stock. Even accidentally. The stock cast flywheel can shatter above ~5,500 RPM - that's an explosion of metal fragments. The billet flywheel is machined from a solid block of aircraft-grade aluminum and is rated to 10,000+ RPM. The billet rod replaces the cast rod that can fail at sustained RPM. These are **safety parts**, not performance parts.

- Your kit's included gaskets

### Workspace
- Clean workbench
- Good lighting
- No distractions during torque-critical steps

## THE PROCEDURE

### PHASE 1: DISASSEMBLY

**Step 1: Document and drain**
- [ ] Photograph engine from all angles (for reassembly reference)
- [ ] Drain oil completely (drain plug AND oil will come out when side cover opens)
- [ ] Let it drain fully into a pan

**Step 2: Remove external components**
- [ ] Remove spark plug wire
- [ ] Disconnect fuel line / drain fuel tank
- [ ] Remove any throttle linkage connected to the carb
- [ ] Remove the blower housing / fan shroud (bolts around perimeter)
- [ ] You now see the flywheel and ignition coil

**Step 3: Remove ignition coil**
- [ ] Note the coil position and air gap (take a photo)
- [ ] Remove 2 mounting bolts
- [ ] Set coil aside, label the wire

**Step 4: Remove stock flywheel**
- [ ] Remove flywheel nut with impact wrench
  - **Non-Hemi: standard thread (counterclockwise to remove)**
- [ ] Thread flywheel puller into the flywheel holes
- [ ] Tighten puller center bolt - flywheel will pop off the taper
- [ ] Remove flywheel key from crankshaft
- [ ] **Inspect crankshaft taper** - must be clean, no burrs, no scoring
- [ ] Set stock flywheel aside (keep it as backup)

**Step 5: Remove side cover**
- [ ] Remove all bolts from the side cover
- [ ] Carefully pry side cover off (more oil will come out - have the drain pan ready)
- [ ] Photograph the inside of the crankcase
- [ ] You can see the governor gear assembly, connecting rod, camshaft gear

### PHASE 2: GOVERNOR REMOVAL

**Step 6: Remove the governor**
- [ ] Identify the governor gear, shaft, and weight assembly inside the crankcase
- [ ] Remove the governor gear and shaft assembly (usually held by a clip or bolt)
- [ ] From the outside of the block: remove the governor arm and shaft
- [ ] Plug or cap the governor shaft hole (your kit may include a plug, or use RTV sealant)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Clean all metal debris from inside the crankcase**
  - Use compressed air carefully
  - Wipe with clean rag
  - Inspect visually - NO metal chips or fragments can remain
  - Tilt engine and let any debris fall out
- [ ] **Second person inspects crankcase for cleanliness** - sign off below

### PHASE 3: BILLET ROD INSTALL

**Step 7: Remove stock connecting rod**
- [ ] Rotate crankshaft to bring the rod to a workable position
- [ ] Note the rod orientation (which side faces out)
- [ ] Remove rod cap bolts
- [ ] Carefully remove rod cap, then slide rod off crank journal
- [ ] Remove piston and rod together if needed (push piston up through cylinder)
- [ ] Set stock rod aside

**Step 8: Install ARC 6254 billet rod**
- [ ] Inspect billet rod - smooth bearing surfaces, no defects
- [ ] Oil the bearing surfaces with fresh 10W-30
- [ ] Install billet rod onto the crank journal in the correct orientation
- [ ] Oil the rod cap bearing surface
- [ ] Install rod cap with the provided ARP bolts
- [ ] **TORQUE ROD BOLTS TO SPECIFICATION** - check your kit documentation for the exact value
  - Typical: 12-14 ft-lbs for ARC 6254 (VERIFY WITH YOUR KIT INSTRUCTIONS)
  - Use a click-type torque wrench
  - This is a CRITICAL torque value - too loose = rod failure, too tight = bolt failure
- [ ] Rotate crank by hand - rod must move freely on the journal, no binding
- [ ] Verify oil dipper on billet rod is oriented correctly (scoops oil from sump)
- [ ] **Second person verifies torque and free rotation** - sign off below

### PHASE 4: REASSEMBLY

**Step 9: Close up the side cover**
- [ ] Clean gasket surfaces on both the block and side cover (scrape old gasket material completely)
- [ ] Install new side cover gasket (from kit)
- [ ] Align side cover carefully (don't pinch gasket)
- [ ] Install bolts finger tight, then tighten in a star pattern
- [ ] Torque side cover bolts: 8-10 ft-lbs (these are small bolts in aluminum - easy to strip)

**Step 10: Install billet flywheel**
- [ ] Install new flywheel key (use the one from your kit if provided, or reuse stock if it fits)
- [ ] Slide ARC 6695 billet flywheel onto crankshaft taper
- [ ] Align keyway with key
- [ ] Install flywheel nut
- [ ] **TORQUE FLYWHEEL NUT: 60-65 ft-lbs** (verify with kit docs)
  - Use a torque wrench, not an impact gun, for final torque
  - Hold flywheel with a strap wrench or flywheel holder
- [ ] Check: flywheel is flush on taper, no wobble when rotated
- [ ] **Second person verifies torque** - sign off below

**Step 11: Install ignition coil**
- [ ] Mount coil in original position (2 bolts)
- [ ] Set air gap between coil laminations and flywheel magnets: **0.010"-0.014"**
  - Use a business card as a rough gauge, or feeler gauge for precision
  - Loosen coil bolts, place gauge, let magnets pull coil to flywheel, tighten bolts, remove gauge
- [ ] Reconnect kill switch wire to coil

**Step 12: Reassemble externals**
- [ ] Install blower housing / fan shroud
- [ ] Install spark plug: Autolite 3910X, gap 0.028"-0.031", torque 12-15 ft-lbs
- [ ] Reconnect fuel line
- [ ] Reconnect throttle linkage
- [ ] Reconnect spark plug wire

**Step 13: Oil and prep**
- [ ] Fill with fresh 10W-30 oil to proper dipstick level
- [ ] Pull engine through BY HAND several times (with spark plug in) - verify no binding
- [ ] Check that everything moves smoothly

## PHASE 5: FIRST START AND BREAK-IN

**STOP - Gate 1 Checklist Before First Pull:**
- [ ] Billet rod torqued and verified by two people
- [ ] Billet flywheel torqued and verified by two people
- [ ] Governor removed, crankcase clean
- [ ] Oil at proper level
- [ ] Coil gap set
- [ ] All covers installed
- [ ] Kill switch connected and accessible
- [ ] **Mr. McAteer has inspected and signed off**

**Step 14: First start**
- [ ] Fuel on, choke on
- [ ] Pull start
- [ ] Let idle and warm up for 2 minutes
- [ ] Listen for ANY unusual sounds (knocking, scraping, rattling)
- [ ] Check for oil leaks (side cover, drain plug)
- [ ] Check for fuel leaks
- [ ] If anything is wrong: KILL ENGINE IMMEDIATELY, diagnose, fix

**Step 15: Break-in (30 minutes total)**
- [ ] Run at varying RPM (2,000-4,000) for 5 minutes, cool down 5 minutes
- [ ] Repeat 3 more times (5 on, 5 off)
- [ ] On the last run, let it rev a little higher (4,000-5,000) briefly
- [ ] DO NOT hold at any single RPM for extended periods during break-in
- [ ] After break-in: shut down, let cool

**Step 16: Post break-in**
- [ ] Drain break-in oil (it carries the worst of the wear particles)
- [ ] Fill with fresh 10W-30
- [ ] Check for leaks one final time
- [ ] Engine is ready for installation in the frame
