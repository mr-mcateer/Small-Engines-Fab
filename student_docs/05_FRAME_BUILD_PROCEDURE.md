## MATERIAL KEY

**COLOR CODE YOUR TUBES BEFORE CUTTING:**
- 0.095" wall (thick) = Mark with RED paint marker on the end (PRIMARY STRUCTURE)
- 0.063" wall (thin) = Mark with BLUE paint marker on the end (SECONDARY STRUCTURE)

This prevents accidentally using thin wall tube where you need thick wall.

## STEP 1: PREPARE THE DONOR BICYCLE

### What You Keep:
- Head tube (the short tube that holds the fork bearings)
- Fork and front wheel
- Handlebars and stem
- Front brake (disc or V-brake)
- Top tube and down tube (cut to ~4-6" behind head tube, or keep to seat tube)
- Seat tube (shortened)

### What You Remove:
- Everything behind the seat tube stays with the bike, you cut it off
- Rear triangle (chainstays, seatstays, rear wheel, rear brake, derailleur)
- Bottom bracket and cranks/pedals (no longer needed)
- Alternatively: keep the seat tube and cut just behind it for a stronger junction

### Cutting the Bicycle Frame:
1. Decide your cut location: behind the seat tube is the most common. This gives you the seat tube as a structural junction point.
2. Mark your cut line with soapstone or marker
3. Cut with angle grinder and cut-off wheel
4. Clean the cut with a flap disc
5. Measure and record the OUTSIDE DIAMETER of the bicycle tubes at the cut (you'll need this to design the sleeve/junction to the rear frame)

---

## STEP 2: DESIGN YOUR CUT LIST

Before cutting ANY square tube, plan ALL cuts on paper.

### Main Frame Rails (0.095" wall - RED)
- 2x main rails: length = wheelbase minus bicycle front section length
  - Typical: 30-36" each (measure from your bicycle cut to desired rear axle position)
- These run parallel, spaced ~14-18" apart (inside edge to inside edge)

### Rear Axle Cross Members (0.095" wall - RED)
- 2x cross tubes at rear: length = rear track width + frame rail overhang
  - Typical: 30-36" each
- These mount the pillow block bearings and must be PERFECTLY PARALLEL

### Engine Mount Frame (0.095" wall - RED)
- Sub-frame or plate support for engine mounting
- Size depends on your Predator 212 bolt pattern (measure your engine base)
- Typically 2x short cross members: ~16-20" each

### Bicycle Junction (0.095" wall - RED)
- Adapter section connecting bike frame to rear frame
- Length and shape depends on how you're joining (sleeve, fish-mouth, etc.)
- Plan for gusset plates here

### Cross Braces (0.063" wall - BLUE)
- 2-4x lateral cross braces between main rails: ~14-18" each
- Adds lateral stiffness and prevents frame racking

### Seat Frame (0.063" wall - BLUE)
- Depends on seat choice - typically 2x rails + 1-2x cross members
- ~12-18" lengths

### Foot Peg Mounts (0.063" wall - BLUE)
- 2x short stubs or brackets: ~4-6" each

### MAP ALL CUTS ONTO STOCK:

```

## STEP 3: CUT ALL TUBES

- [ ] Double-check each measurement before cutting
- [ ] Two people verify each measurement
- [ ] Cut with band saw, chop saw, or angle grinder
- [ ] Deburr ALL cut ends (inside and outside) with file or flap disc
- [ ] Label each piece with its piece number (paint marker or tape)
- [ ] Check off each piece on the cut list as completed

---

## STEP 4: WELD THE REAR FRAME (ON THE FLAT TABLE)

**This is the most critical welding step. The frame MUST be flat and square.**

### Setup:
1. Clean the welding table
2. Set up angle iron or bar stock as a jig along one edge
3. Use clamps and magnets to hold pieces in position
4. Verify your welder settings on scrap first (these are thin-wall tubes)

### Welding Parameters (MIG, 0.095" wall mild steel):
- Wire: ER70S-6, 0.030" or 0.035"
- Gas: 75/25 Ar/CO2
- Voltage: ~17-19V
- Wire speed: ~250-350 IPM
- Technique: Short stringer beads, watch for burn-through

### Welding Parameters (MIG, 0.063" wall mild steel):
- Same wire and gas
- Voltage: ~16-17V (LOWER - this is thin)
- Wire speed: ~200-280 IPM
- BE CAREFUL of burn-through - use tack-and-skip technique if needed

### Assembly Order:
1. Lay out the two main rails parallel on the table
2. Measure spacing at front and rear - MUST BE EQUAL
3. Tack weld the rear cross member(s) to both rails
4. Check diagonals: measure corner to corner both ways - MUST BE EQUAL (within 1/8")
5. If not square, tap with a dead blow hammer until square, re-tack
6. Tack weld the remaining cross braces
7. Check square again
8. Full weld all joints (all around each tube junction)
9. Flip frame and weld backside of all joints
10. Check for flat - lay a straightedge across the frame

---

## STEP 5: JOIN BICYCLE FRONT END TO REAR FRAME

### Junction Design Options:

**Option A: Sleeve Joint**
- Find or make a tube that the bicycle seat tube slides INSIDE of
- Weld sleeve to front of rear frame
- Slide bicycle into sleeve, align, weld

**Option B: Fish-Mouth / Cope Joint**
- Cope (notch) the square tube to wrap around the round bicycle tube
- Requires careful fitting with grinder or tube notcher
- Strong joint when done right

**Option C: Plate Junction**
- Weld a flat plate to the rear frame front
- Weld the bicycle tubes to the plate
- Easiest to get strong, hardest to make look clean

### For ALL options:
1. Clamp bicycle front section to rear frame
2. Check alignment: Is the front wheel centered between the main rails?
3. Check from behind: Is the front wheel VERTICAL (not leaning left or right)?
4. String a line from rear axle centerline to front axle - should be straight
5. Tack weld when aligned
6. Re-check alignment
7. Full weld
8. **ADD GUSSETS** - minimum 2 gusset plates at this joint (CNC plasma cut triangles from 1/4" or 3/16" plate)
9. Gussets bridge from the bicycle tubes to the square tube frame
10. This joint carries the highest bending load on the entire trike

---

## STEP 6: FABRICATE AND WELD ENGINE MOUNT

1. Measure Predator 212 base bolt pattern (4 bolts)
2. Options:
   - **Plate mount:** CNC plasma cut a mounting plate from 1/4" plate. Drill bolt holes on the mill. Weld plate to frame sub-structure.
   - **Tube mount:** Build a rectangular sub-frame from 0.095" tube that the engine bolts sit on. Drill through the tube walls.
3. Position: Engine centered or slightly offset to align output shaft with chain path to rear axle
4. **CRITICAL:** The engine output shaft (crankshaft) centerline height must match the torque converter/clutch driven sprocket height on the rear axle. MEASURE THIS before welding the mount in place.
5. Use slotted mounting holes if possible (allows adjustment)

---

## STEP 7: FABRICATE AND WELD AXLE BEARING MOUNTS

1. The rear axle sits in two pillow block bearings (or bearing hangers)
2. These bearings bolt to mounting plates welded to the frame
3. **CNC plasma cut** two mounting plates from 1/4" plate
4. **Drill bearing bolt holes on the mill** for precision
5. The two mounting plates MUST BE:
   - At the same height
   - Parallel to each other
   - Perpendicular to the frame rails
   - Level
6. **Slotted holes** (elongated front-to-back) allow chain tension adjustment
7. Weld plates to the rear cross members of the frame
8. Bolt (don't weld) the bearings to the plates

### Alignment Check:
- Thread the axle through both bearings
- Spin the axle by hand - must rotate freely with no binding
- If it binds, the bearing mounts are not aligned - correct before proceeding

---

## STEP 8: ADDITIONAL FABRICATION

- [ ] Seat mounting brackets/rails
- [ ] Foot peg mounts
- [ ] Chain guard (flat stock bent to shape, or sheet metal)
- [ ] Brake caliper mounting bracket (for rear disc brake)
- [ ] Throttle cable routing guides (small tabs welded to frame)
- [ ] Tether kill switch mount
- [ ] Any cosmetic touches

---

## STEP 9: WELD INSPECTION

Before any assembly or paint:

- [ ] Visual inspection of ALL welds - look for:
  - Porosity (holes/pits in the weld)
  - Undercut (groove along weld edge)
  - Cold lap (weld sitting on top, not fused)
  - Cracks
  - Incomplete fusion
- [ ] Mr. McAteer inspects and signs off on all structural welds
- [ ] Grind any welds that need re-work
- [ ] Re-weld any failed inspections

---

## STEP 10: FINISH

- [ ] Grind/clean all welds for appearance
- [ ] Scuff entire frame with scotch-brite or wire wheel
- [ ] Wipe with acetone or prep solvent
- [ ] Prime with rust-preventive primer
- [ ] Paint with color of choice (rattle can is fine, powder coat is better)
- [ ] Let cure fully before assembly

## MEASUREMENT LOG

Record key measurements as you go. If something doesn't fit later, these help diagnose why.

| Measurement | Design Value | Actual Value | Date | By |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------|-----|
| Main rail spacing (front) | " | " | | |
| Main rail spacing (rear) | " | " | | |
| Diagonal #1 (front-L to rear-R) | " | " | | |
| Diagonal #2 (front-R to rear-L) | " | " | | |
| Wheelbase (front axle to rear axle) | " | " | | |
| Engine shaft height from ground | " | " | | |
| Rear axle height from ground | " | " | | |
| Bearing mount spacing | " | " | | |
| Seat height from ground | " | " | | |
