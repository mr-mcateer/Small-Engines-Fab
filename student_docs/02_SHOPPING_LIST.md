## ORDER STRATEGY

1. **Pick your plan** (discuss with Mr. McAteer)
2. **Order drivetrain parts first** - they take the longest to ship
3. **Pick up steel from Ram Steelco** (Salem - Will Call, Quote #849416)
4. **Grab PVC, bolts, paint from Home Depot** - day trip or after school
5. **Pick up donor bicycle frame(s)** - Mr. McAteer has located options

*Order early. Shipping time is the bottleneck.*
