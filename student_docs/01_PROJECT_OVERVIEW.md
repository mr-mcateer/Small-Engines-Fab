# PROJECT DRIFT TRIKE
## Colton & Atticus | CVHS Small Engines + Fabrication
## Instructor: Mr. McAteer

---

## THE MISSION

Build a motorized drift trike that represents Crescent Valley High School's Small Engines and Fabrication programs. This trike will have the school's name on it and demonstrate what these two classes can build together.

**What it is:** A slow, heavy, drifty, safe showpiece.
**What it is NOT:** A speed machine.

## WHAT YOU HAVE

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Predator 212cc Non-Hemi engine (69730) with Stage 1 mods | In the shop |
| Billet flywheel (ARC 6695) + billet rod (ARC 6254) | Purchased, ready to install |
| 1.25" x 1.25" square tube - 0.095" wall (50 ft) | Ordered from Ram Steelco, Salem |
| 1.25" x 1.25" square tube - 0.063" wall (48 ft) | Ordered from Ram Steelco, Salem |
| Donor steel bicycle frame(s) | Located - need to pick up |
| Full metals lab: CNC plasma, knee mills, lathes, MIG welders | Available |

## WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO THE ENGINE

**Installing billet flywheel and billet rod.** That's it. You're NOT installing the cam or heavy valve springs from the kit. The stock cam is fine for a slow drift trike. The billet parts are for SAFETY - they prevent the flywheel from exploding and the rod from breaking if the engine revs past stock limits.

You're also removing the governor so the engine responds naturally to the throttle instead of cutting out at 3,600 RPM.

## THREE BUILD PLANS - YOU CHOOSE

Mr. McAteer has prepared three options for the rear axle/wheel/drivetrain system. The engine build, frame, brakes, and safety equipment are the same in all three. Read the Engineering Plan document for full details.

| | Plan A: Kit Build | Plan B: Hybrid | Plan C: Full Fabrication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Buy BMI Karts complete axle kit with tires, wheels, clutch | Buy axle + bearings + clutch separately, use Amazon wheels, machine hub adapters | Buy minimum parts, fabricate hubs, adapters, everything possible in-house |
| **Cost** | ~$460-520 | ~$357-437 | ~$292-365 |
| **Shop Time** | Less (focus on frame + CNC) | Medium (hub adapter machining project) | Most (serious lathe and mill work) |
| **"We Built This"** | Good | Great | Maximum |
| **Risk** | Lowest | Medium | Higher (precision machining required) |

**Discuss with Mr. McAteer and decide.**

## SAFETY GATES - THE PROJECT DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THESE

There are 5 hard checkpoints (gates). You cannot advance past a gate until Mr. McAteer signs off.

| Gate | What Must Be Done | Who Signs Off |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0 | Design complete: dimensioned sketch, cut list, parts ordered | Mr. McAteer |
| 1 | Engine build: billet parts installed, torques verified by two people | Mr. McAteer |
| 2 | Engine running: bench test, kill switch works, no leaks | Mr. McAteer |
| 3 | Frame complete: welds inspected, frame flat and square | Mr. McAteer |
| 4 | Drivetrain assembled: axle, wheels, clutch, chain, all fasteners | Mr. McAteer |
| 5 | Safety systems: brakes, kill switch, tether, throttle return, all bolts | Mr. McAteer |

**No skipping. No "we'll fix it later." Every gate must pass before the next phase starts.**

## HOW YOU'LL WORK

1. **Think first.** Before you cut, weld, or bolt anything - sketch it, measure it, discuss it.
2. **Two-person verify.** All critical torque values and measurements get checked by both of you.
3. **Document everything.** Phone photos at every step. This is your project portfolio.
4. **Ask if you're unsure.** Mr. McAteer is here. If something doesn't look right, stop and ask.
5. **No rushing at critical phases.** The engine internals and the welding table are where mistakes become permanent.

## YOUR DELIVERABLES

By the end of this project:

1. A running, rideable drift trike with CVHS branding
2. A dimensioned design sketch (hand-drawn or CAD)
3. A photo log of the build process
4. Gear ratio and frame stress calculations (with Mr. McAteer's help)
5. A "lessons learned" write-up
6. A presentation showing off the finished trike

*Two classes. Two students. One trike. CVHS on the back.*
