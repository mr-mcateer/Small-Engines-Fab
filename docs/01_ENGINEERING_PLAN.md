# CVHS Drift Trike - Three Build Plans
## Crescent Valley High School | Small Engines + Fabrication
### Colton Hankey & Atticus | Instructor: Mr. McAteer

---

## ENGINE STATUS: CONFIRMED

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Engine | Predator 212cc **Non-Hemi** (model 69730) |
| Current State | Stage 1 already installed (air filter, exhaust, carb work) |
| Purchased Kit | Stage 2 "premium" kit with 10K billet flywheel |
| What We're Installing | **Billet flywheel (ARC 6695) + Billet connecting rod (ARC 6254) ONLY** |
| What We're Skipping | Cam and valve spring upgrades (not needed for a slow drifty showpiece) |
| Governor | Remove - but engine won't be pushed hard anyway |
| Target Power | ~8-9 HP, comfortable cruising at 3,000-4,500 RPM |
| Why Billet Anyway? | Safety. Even if you never rev past 5,000, the billet flywheel and rod are insurance. Stock cast parts are a liability once the governor is gone. |

**The goal is a slow, heavy, safe, drifty trike with CVHS branding that shows off what both programs can build. Not a speed machine.**

---

## THREE PLANS - PICK ONE

Each plan produces the same trike. The difference is how you source the rear axle/wheels and how much machining you do vs. how much you buy ready-made.

All three plans share the same:
- Engine build (billet flywheel + rod, governor removal)
- Frame design and fabrication
- Brakes and safety equipment
- Controls (throttle, kill switch, tether)

The ONLY difference is the drivetrain/axle/wheel approach.

---

# PLAN A: "THE KIT BUILD"
## Buy a complete BMI Karts drift trike axle kit. Minimum hassle, maximum time for frame fabrication and CNC work.

### What You Buy

| Item | Source | Est. Cost |
|------|--------|-----------|
| BMI Karts Drift Trike Axle Kit w/ Tires, Rims, & Clutch (#35 chain, 40" axle) | bmikarts.com | ~$300-350 |
| *Kit includes:* 1" x 40" live axle, 3x aluminum hubs (1" bore), 2x bearing hangers, 56T #35 sprocket, #35 chain + masterlink, 12T centrifugal clutch (3/4" bore), 2x Unilli 10.5x4.50-6 racing slicks, 2x 6" aluminum wheels, keystock, lock collars | | |
| PVC pipe for drift sleeves (6" Sched 40, 4') | Home Depot | ~$20 |
| Mechanical disc brake kit (rear axle) | Amazon | ~$30-40 |
| 7/8" twist throttle kit w/ cable + kill switch | Amazon | ~$15-20 |
| Tether / deadman kill switch | Amazon | ~$10-15 |
| Go-kart seat (low profile aluminum) | Amazon/GPS | ~$30-40 |
| Bolt assortment (Grade 5/8) | Hardware store | ~$20 |
| 1/4" flat plate for gussets + brackets (~12"x24") | Ram Steelco scrap or order | ~$15 |
| Spray paint / primer | Hardware store | ~$20 |
| **PLAN A TOTAL** | | **~$460-520** |

### Tradeoffs

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Everything fits together - proven kit | Less machining experience for students |
| Fastest path to a rolling chassis | Slightly more expensive |
| Centrifugal clutch included - simple, reliable | Less "we built it ourselves" bragging rights on drivetrain |
| Bearing hangers bolt right on | Students don't design axle system from first principles |

### CNC/Machining Opportunities (Plan A still gets shop time)
- CNC plasma: gusset plates, engine mount plate, brake caliper bracket, CVHS nameplate/logo for rear
- Mill: face bearing mount plates, drill engine mount holes
- Lathe: spacers, any adapter bushings needed

---

# PLAN B: "THE HYBRID"
## Buy an axle + bearings + clutch separately, use Colton's Amazon wheels, machine your own hub adapters.

### What You Buy

| Item | Source | Est. Cost |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1" x 40" keyed live steel axle | Amazon/OMB Warehouse | ~$30-40 |
| 1" Pillow block bearings (2x) - UCP205-16 | Amazon | ~$25-30 |
| 1" bore aluminum hubs (3x) | GoPowerSports/Amazon | ~$30-45 |
| 60T #35 sprocket | GoPowerSports | ~$20 |
| Centrifugal clutch 3/4" bore, 12T, #35 chain | Amazon | ~$20-35 |
| #35 chain (5 ft) + master link | Amazon | ~$12-15 |
| 1/4" x 12" keystock | Hardware store | ~$5 |
| 1" lock collars (4x) | Amazon | ~$10-12 |
| Colton's Amazon wheels: ECILKUC 10x4.5-5 (pair) | Amazon | ~$60-80 |
| PVC pipe for drift sleeves (6" Sched 40, 4') | Home Depot | ~$20 |
| Mechanical disc brake kit (rear axle) | Amazon | ~$30-40 |
| 7/8" twist throttle kit w/ cable + kill switch | Amazon | ~$15-20 |
| Tether / deadman kill switch | Amazon | ~$10-15 |
| Go-kart seat (low profile) | Amazon/GPS | ~$30-40 |
| Bolt assortment (Grade 5/8) | Hardware store | ~$20 |
| 1/4" flat plate for gussets + brackets + hub adapters | Ram Steelco or order | ~$20 |
| Spray paint / primer | Hardware store | ~$20 |
| **PLAN B TOTAL** | | **~$357-437** |

### Tradeoffs

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| ~$80-100 cheaper than Plan A | Hub adapters require precision machining |
| Hub adapter project = real machining skill | More parts to source = more shipping/waiting |
| Students design the axle assembly from scratch | If hub adapters don't fit well, rework costs time |
| More "we built this" factor | More alignment work during assembly |

### The Hub Adapter Project (Plan B Highlight)
This is the key learning opportunity in Plan B. Colton's Amazon wheels have a bolt pattern designed for a standard go-kart hub. Your 1" keyed axle hubs may have a different bolt circle. Students must:
1. **Measure** the Amazon wheel bolt pattern (bolt circle diameter + number of holes)
2. **Measure** the axle hub bolt pattern
3. **Design** an adapter plate that bolts to the hub and accepts the wheel
4. **CNC plasma** or **mill** the adapter from 1/4" flat plate
5. **Drill** precision bolt holes on the knee mill using DRO
6. **Test fit** and iterate if needed

This is genuine machining work - tolerance matters, concentricity matters, bolt pattern must be accurate.

---

# PLAN C: "FULL FABRICATION"
## Build or source the minimum purchased components. Fabricate bearing mounts, hubs, everything possible in-house. Maximum shop learning, minimum spending.

### What You Buy

| Item | Source | Est. Cost |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1" x 40" keyed live steel axle | Amazon/OMB Warehouse | ~$30-40 |
| 1" pillow block bearings (2x) - UCP205-16 | Amazon | ~$25-30 |
| Centrifugal clutch 3/4" bore, 12T, #35 chain | Amazon | ~$20-35 |
| #35 chain (5 ft) + master link | Amazon | ~$12-15 |
| 1/4" x 12" keystock | Hardware store | ~$5 |
| Colton's Amazon wheels: ECILKUC 10x4.5-5 (pair) | Amazon | ~$60-80 |
| PVC pipe for drift sleeves (6" Sched 40, 4') | Home Depot | ~$20 |
| Mechanical disc brake kit (rear axle) | Amazon | ~$30-40 |
| 7/8" twist throttle kit w/ cable + kill switch | Amazon | ~$15-20 |
| Tether / deadman kill switch | Amazon | ~$10-15 |
| Steel flat stock/plate for all fabricated parts | Shop stock / Ram Steelco | ~$25-35 |
| Bolt assortment (Grade 5/8) | Hardware store | ~$20 |
| Spray paint / primer | Hardware store | ~$20 |
| **PLAN C TOTAL** | | **~$292-365** |

### What Students Fabricate (Plan C)

| Component | Method | Material |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Axle hubs (3x) | **Lathe** - turn from round steel stock, bore to 1" with keyway | 1.5-2" round mild steel bar |
| Hub adapter plates | **Mill** + CNC plasma | 1/4" flat plate |
| Sprocket hub | **Lathe** + mill for keyway and bolt holes | Round stock |
| Bearing mount plates | **CNC plasma** + face on mill | 1/4" plate |
| Engine mount plate | **CNC plasma** + drill on mill | 1/4" plate |
| Brake caliper bracket | **CNC plasma** or mill from flat | 1/4" plate |
| Seat (from square tube) | **Weld** a frame, bolt plywood + padding | 0.063" square tube + plywood |
| CVHS nameplate | **CNC plasma** cut from plate | 1/8" or 3/16" plate |
| Lock collars | **Lathe** - turn and drill, tap for set screw | Round stock |

### Tradeoffs

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Cheapest option by ~$100-150 | Significant lathe and mill time |
| Maximum hands-on fabrication learning | Hubs and lock collars require precision |
| True "built from scratch" bragging rights | Higher risk of rework if tolerances are off |
| Best demonstration of shop capabilities | Longest timeline - more things to make |
| Great for portfolio / program showcase | Axle alignment more challenging without kit parts |

## WHAT'S THE SAME IN ALL THREE PLANS

### Engine Build (Applies to A, B, and C)
1. Remove side cover, remove governor gear/shaft, clean crankcase
2. Install ARC 6254 billet connecting rod (torque to spec)
3. Install ARC 6695 billet flywheel (60-65 ft-lbs on nut)
4. Set ignition coil air gap (0.010-0.014")
5. Install new side cover gasket, reassemble
6. **Do NOT install the cam or valve springs from the kit** - stock cam and springs are fine for our low-RPM use
7. Oil change, spark plug (Autolite 3910X), break-in procedure

### Frame (Applies to A, B, and C)

**Dimensions:**
- Wheelbase: 52-56"
- Rear track width: 30-34"
- Seat height: 10-14" from ground
- Ground clearance: 3-4" minimum

**Materials (from Ram Steelco order):**
- 0.095" wall: Main frame rails, axle cross-members, engine mount, bicycle junction + gussets
- 0.063" wall: Cross-braces, seat frame, foot pegs, chain guard frame, cosmetic pieces

**Frame Build Sequence:**
1. Prepare donor bicycle (cut behind seat tube)
2. Build rear frame flat on welding table (tack, check square, full weld)
3. Join bicycle front to rear frame with gussets (highest stress joint)
4. Weld engine mount sub-frame
5. Weld axle bearing mount plates
6. Add seat frame, foot pegs, chain guard frame
7. Weld inspection by Mr. McAteer
8. Grind, clean, prime, paint

### Safety Equipment (Applies to A, B, and C - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Item | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Billet flywheel + billet rod | Prevents catastrophic engine failure | In kit |
| Handlebar kill switch | Rider kills engine instantly | Must buy |
| Tether/deadman switch | Engine dies if rider separates | Must buy |
| Throttle return spring | Throttle closes if released or cable breaks | Verify with throttle kit |
| Front brake (from bicycle) | Primary stopping brake | From donor bike |
| Rear disc brake | Secondary brake on rear axle | Must buy |
| Chain guard | Prevents chain contact with rider/clothing | Fabricate |
| Helmet, gloves, long pants, closed shoes | Personal protection | Student responsibility |
| Fire extinguisher | Nearby for all engine runs | Lab stock |

### Controls (Applies to A, B, and C)

| Control | Location | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| 7/8" twist throttle | Right grip | Amazon ~$15-20 |
| Front brake lever | Left hand | From donor bicycle |
| Rear brake lever | Right hand or foot pedal | With brake kit or bicycle lever |
| Kill switch button | Left handlebar | With throttle kit or separate |
| Tether clip | Frame or handlebar | With tether kit |

## SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON

| Factor | Plan A (Kit) | Plan B (Hybrid) | Plan C (Full Fab) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Total Cost** | ~$460-520 | ~$357-437 | ~$292-365 |
| **Savings vs A** | -- | ~$80-100 | ~$130-170 |
| **Machining Time** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Fabrication Showcase** | Good (frame + CNC) | Better (frame + hubs + CNC) | Best (everything from stock) |
| **Risk of Rework** | Low | Medium | Higher |
| **Time to Rolling Chassis** | Fastest | Medium | Longest |
| **"We Built This" Factor** | Good | Great | Maximum |
| **Program Showcase Value** | Shows welding + CNC | Shows welding + CNC + machining | Shows FULL shop capability |
| **Recommended For** | If timeline is tight | **Best balance for this project** | If students want the challenge |

**Mr. McAteer's Recommendation: Plan B** gives the best balance of cost savings, learning value (the hub adapter project is real engineering), and a reasonable timeline. It showcases welding, CNC plasma, AND precision machining. Plan A if you're short on time. Plan C if Colton and Atticus want to go all-in.

## CVHS BRANDING IDEAS

This trike represents both programs. Some CNC plasma projects for the nameplate:

- CNC plasma cut "CVHS" or school logo from 1/8" steel plate, weld to rear frame
- CNC plasma cut "Small Engines + Fabrication" text for side panels
- Powder coat or paint in school colors
- If ambitious: CNC plasma cut decorative side panels (perforated pattern showing the tube frame underneath)

These are excellent portfolio pieces for the CNC plasma program.
